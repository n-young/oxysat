"""
In four or so sentences, compare how quickly Forge is able
to find an instance for some spec from a previous homework
using your solver compared to the default one (with the above
line removed). You can find the solve time (time spent in
the actual SAT solver) in the debug information Forge prints
before launching Sterling. Note down what spec you used and
what the solve times were for a sat and unsat instance for
your solver and for the default one.
